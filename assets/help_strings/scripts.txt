Scripts are python scripts that run over PocketPy. Standalone scripts can be run on their own, or can be run from other scripts using the `run_standalone_scripts` function. If a standalone script is called "autorun", it will be run every launch. Also see [ðŸ”» Filter Scripts]0 and [ðŸ”¤ Sorting Scripts]1.
